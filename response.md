# Payment Plan Bug

**Participants:** Branko, Jernej, Urban, Ervin, Dušica

**Summary:** The email thread discusses a payment plan bug that needs to be resolved as soon as possible. Due to Ervin's unavailability, Branko is moving the issue to Urban, who will investigate whether recent platform upgrades have affected the payment plan's behavior. Urban will work over the weekend, with Dušica providing support from a business analyst perspective, to decide on the next steps and agree on the dynamics.
