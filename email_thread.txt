Hi Jernej,

 

As we agreed, I am moving the payment plan issue to Urban since Ervin is not well, and we need a resolution as soon as possible.

 

Urban will first check whether the platform upgrades influenced the payment plan's behavior. Based on the results, we will decide how to proceed.

 

We also agreed Urban will work during the weekend, and Du≈°ica will support him from a BA perspective. They will decide and agree on the dynamics.
